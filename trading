"""
By looking at the evolution of XPO Logistics' price during the last year, we can notice that after a certain time, 
the stock always come back to a value close to 192, which leads me to think that a mean reversion algorithm
would be suitable in this case.
Therefore, I will use a mean reversion algorithm. The details of steps are summarized in the pdf file attached to my email.
